# Predicting the stock market

In this project, we'll aim to predict the S&P 500 index based on its history, using a linear regression model.

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data science with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/predicting_stock_market/blob/main/PredictingStockMarket.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.

## Reproduction

In case you want to reproduce the project in a Jupyter Notebook in your own environment.

Download both the .ipynb file and the file sphist.csv into the same folder.

Before starting Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* datetime
* matplotlib.pyplot
* pandas.plotting
* sklearn.linear_model
* sklearn.metrics
* sklearn.preprocessing
